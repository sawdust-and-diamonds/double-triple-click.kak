# double-triple-click.kak

This is a [kakoune](http://kakoune.org) plugin that recreates the familiar double- and triple-click functionality of your favourite graphical editor.

I've created this plugin with people new to kakoune (and modal editors in general) in mind. Many veterans prefer to do everything by keyboard‚Äîand I definitely encourage you to explore this philosophy!‚Äîbut with this small extension, you can quickly add familiar mouse operations to a new installation of kakoune, and start selecting words and lines with mouse clicks, just as you would in your favourite graphical editor or IDE. 

For advanced users, there is the option to turn off the default functionality completely, and create your own using a new set of hooks.

## Installation

You can just pop double-triple-click.kak into your autoload folder‚Äîon Linux, it's at: `~/.config/kak/autoload/`.

It's worth using [plug.kak](https://github.com/andreyorst/plug.kak) to manage your plugins. Add the following to your kakrc (after the line where you load plug itself, of course):
```
plug 'sawdust-and-diamonds/double-triple-click.kak'
```

## Usage (Default)

Simply install, and start double- or triple-clicking‚Äîit should work just as it does in most IDEs. Double-click a word to select it, or triple-click to select a whole line.

The plugin is not yet correctly configured to handle multiple selections, but please expect this in the next update.

## Customizing

The plugin adds four new interfaces to the User hook for custom double- and triple-click behaviour:

```
NormalDoubleClick
NormalTripleClick
InsertDoubleClick
InsertTripleClick
```

Each of these act in a similar way‚Äîthey're simply sent as parameters to the User hook when the required event happens. To alter the default behaviour, re-bind them after the line where you've put `plug 'sawdust-and-diamonds/double-triple-click.kak'` in your kakrc. To read more about how hooks work, just type `:doc hooks` while in kakoune.

Below are some concrete examples of how to do this:

##### Triple-click to select a paragraph
```
hook global User NormalTripleClick %{ exec '<a-a>p' }
hook global User InsertTripleClick %{ exec '<a-;><a-a>p' }
```

##### Double-click to go to definition in LSP, select word otherwise (requires LSP plugin)
These are rather complicated, but should at least help you open up the possibility of doing cool new things:
```
hook global User NormalDoubleClick %sh{
    cur_sel=$kak_val_selection
    echo "try %{lsp-definition} catch %{nop}"
    echo "eval %sh{[ \$kak_val_selection = $cur_sel ] && echo \"exec '<a-a>w'\"}"
}
hook global User InsertDoubleClick %sh{
    cur_sel=$kak_val_selection
    echo "try %{lsp-definition} catch %{nop}"
    echo "eval %sh{[ \$kak_val_selection = $cur_sel ] && echo \"exec '<a-;><a-a>w'\"}"
}
```

## License

I leave this little scrap of code, for you, in the public domain under the UNLICENSE‚Äîbecause I would like you to consider how to use the multi-click functionality in your own user modes and in your own kakoune projects! Alternatively, if the public domain law does not apply in your country, please refer to the MIT license.

Perhaps one day, however, there might even be a native NormalDoubleClick hook in the compiled kakoune binaries üòÅ.
